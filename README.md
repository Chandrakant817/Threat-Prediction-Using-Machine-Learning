Technologies used Google Cloud, T- Pot(Open Source) and Machine Learning

##                              ABSTRACT:
Real-time detection and response is one of the most effective way to cyber threats introduced to servers and clients by aggressive, intelligent and sometime real-time 
attackers. Every node in the network is considered to be a weak point for a potential attacker to take advantage of. Therefore detection and response at endpoint must be 
extremely effective to erradicate any chances of exposure of such weak points to potential attackers. So as to shift from a traditional approach which fails to detect 
diverse attack scenarios to a more smart, intelligent way and introduce machine learning to many techniques used to detect and prevent unauthorised access to 
systems. Thus we look at multiple techniques for different scenarios and advantages of the same.

##                          PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Network systems contain valuable data and resources that must be protected from attackers. Security experts often use honeypots and honeynets to protect network systems.
Honeypot is an outstanding technology that security experts use to tap new hacking techniques from attackers and intruders.The purpose of Honeypot systems is to log every possible malicious activity of an attacker depending on the type of Honeypot system implemented within infrastructure.

Honeypot systems can be used to identify different types of malicious activities such as web applications attacks, known vulnerability exploitation, exploitation of 
outdated software/system and automated attacks by malicious bots.

##                        Scope of the Project:
• The main aim is to analysis and detect the malicious actors and his attack pattern.

• Prediction of the pattern so that the know attack can be mitigated.
