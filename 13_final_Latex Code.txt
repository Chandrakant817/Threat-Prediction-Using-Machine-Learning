\section{\Large \textbf{Introduction}}

\subsection{\large Problem Definition: }
Network systems contain valuable data and resources that must be protected from attackers. Security experts often use honeypots and honeynets to protect network systems. 
Honeypot is an outstanding technology that security experts use to tap new hacking techniques from attackers and intruders.
The purpose of Honeypot systems is to log every possible  malicious activity of an attacker depending on the type of Honeypot system implemented within infrastructure. 
Honeypot systems can be used to identify different types of malicious activities such as web applications attacks, known vulnerability exploitation, exploitation of outdated software/system and automated attacks by malicious bots.
\\
\\
\\
\subsection{Scope of the Project: }
•	The main aim is to analysis and detect the malicious actors and his attack pattern.\\
\\
•	Prediction of the pattern so that the know attack can be mitigated.\\

\subsection{Objective}
•   To use free and open-source technologies and methods to reduce the amount of manual intervention needed to      add to or modify high-interaction honeypots.\\
\\
•   Identify malicious IP addresses and vulnerabilities being exploited, so that they can be patched as quickly     as possible.\\
\\
•   Discover users that exhibit risky behaviour way before they execute the intended harm to the network.\\
\\
•   Deploy a number of decoys to lure attackers that get past other defenses.\\
\\
•   To detect attack patterns using machine learning and come out with solution to mitigate the attacks.\\

\section{\Large \textbf{Review of Literature: }}
Liberios Vokorokos, et.al, 2013 [1], proposed the urbane 
hybrid honeypot system. These systems Propagates and 
maintains the interaction with attackers and record all 
activities and perform data analysis, thus allowing improving 
security of computer systems. Furthermore in order to 
induce security authors also did managed to amalgamate 
passive fingerprinting technique. It also promotes the 
implementation of multiple Decoys (two Decoy Servers) in 
order to reduce the probability of missing the malicious 
activity on the server by changing the level of interaction.\\
\\
Albert Sagala, 2015 [2], emerged with an idea of collaborative 
honeypot and intrusion Detection System where in the logs file from Honeypot server is passed on to the snort in order to 
generate the rules for Snort that acts similar to the firewall. 
The rules for the SNORT will be inevitably generated by the 
IDS using the logs provided by the honeypot tracked by the 
system. The rules generated are in the form of alerts for
illegal activity.\\

Rahul koul [2017] Modern Attack Detection Using Intelligent Honeypot
A Honeypot is a network system to determine the 
unauthorized use of information system by analyzing the 
behaviour of attacker in an isolated and monitored 
environment. But, there are tons of honeypot implementation 
implemented till date, however one thing missing from each of 
the honeypot implementation is continuous learning of 
trending attack scenarios and no human decision-making
capabilities. In this paper, we proposed a solution for detecting 
modern attacks by introducing a semi automatic approach of 
attack detection via honeypot coupled with human decisionmaking capabilities.\\
\\
Similarly, Jaiganesh, Sumathi, and Vinitha (2013) compared two data mining 
classification algorithms for intrusion detection system, Iterative Dichotomiser2 (ID3) algorithm 
and C4.5 algorithm. The results presented by Jaiganesh et al. (2013) shows C4.5 algorithm was 
best suited for intrusion detection, because it uses numeric and nominal data\\

Chaitanya D Patil, Thyagarajamurthy A "Integration of Honeypots and Machine Learning in Network Security"
Conventionally, corporate information security focuses on deploying antivirus and antimalware tools that 
provided defensive security control of the business information systems. In this security approach, the 
information security officer relies on the signature or heuristic detection strategies adopted by the security 
solution to identify and mitigate threats facing the company. Although this framework offers robust security 
management for the known threats, it fails to effectively analyze the nature of the attack, review the risk, 
and understand the intent of the attacker. Such weaknesses limit the ability of this security management 
framework to effectively contain new threats, which do not have their signatures or heuristics extracted yet. 
It is due to these security management flaws that honeypots are developed and deployed at the corporate 
network. A honeypot is a security resource designed and implemented to lure attackers, enabling them to 
probe, attack, and compromise the system [4]. \\

\underline{Software Requirement: }\\
Puppet : It is an automation software for IT system administrators. It is used to automate repetitive tasks such as the installation of applications and services, patch management, and deployments.\\
\\
Elasticsearch : It is used because it is able to achieve fast search responses instead of searching the text directly, it searches an index instead. Elasticsearch is designed to be scalable and distributed.\\ 
\\
Kibana : Kibana is an open source (Apache Licensed) browser based analytics and search  dashboard for Elasticsearch that visualized the data to provide a better interpretation. It was used  to visualize captured logs from compromised honeypots.\\
\\
HonSSH : A high-interaction HoneyPot solution designed to log all SSH communications between a client and server.\\
\\
\subsection{Methodology: }
•	The virtual machine based honeynet has of 4 honeypot systems, a centralized logging host and Puppet automation host. Each honeypot system is consisted with three individual hosts;a router, a firewall, and a Linux server host. The Linux server provided a Secure Shell (SSH) service to act as the target for attackers.\\
\\
•	Data will be collected using Logstash, an open source data collection engine with real-time  pipelining capabilities. Logstash can dynamically unify data from disparate sources and  normalize the data into destinations. It cleanses and democratizes data for diverse advanced  downstream analytics and visualization use. This was chosen because of its centralized log  management which was used to collect all logs from compromised honeypots.\\
\\
•	Analysis on source IP addresses, attack patterns, countries, username and passwords used to gain access, source ports, commands etc.\\ 
\\
•	Keylogging will be an important part of the analysis process thus we can also tell apart between a real human interaction or a bot trying to brute force its way through.\\
\\
•	Supervised machine learning algorithms will be used to classify SSH attacks based on attack nature Split into two data Severe and Not so severe attacks.\\
\\
•	Honeypotter will focus on detection, forensics and response including:\\
o	Real-time customizable and detection from multiple sources, network behaviour, optional automation, full session assembly, protocol decoding and full content analysis.

\section{\Large \textbf{Conclusion: }}
The research designed and implemented a real-time Honeynet system using Machine learning for detecting and preventing system attacks. System services on Apache Webserver, MYSQL, FTP and SMTP were used to lure attackers.The problem nowadays is that a very good hacker will most likely be able to understand when he is attacking a honeypot. Low interaction honeypots will be able to identify mostly automated attack and will hardly be able to understand new hacker method. On the other hand, high interaction systems are here to entrap the hacker and make him give away his techniques and tools to the forensic team. The network administrator implementing this kind of honeypot should make sure that the system is completely isolated from the production network. This is the best defense if the hacker compromises the honeypot.We have proposed a machine learning model to classify SSH attacks based on the attack nature.
In this semester we are done with literature survey and in next semester we will implement it.
